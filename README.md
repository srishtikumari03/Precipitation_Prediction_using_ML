# Precipitation_Prediction_using_ML

## **INTRODUCTION**

This project aims to create models that can predict whether precipitation will occur or not in LA using common machine learning techniques. 

 ## **TECHNOLOGIES USED**
 
*‚óè Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn & Seaborn*

## **METHODOLOGY**

#### **Data importing and exploration**

- We will use dataset from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xaspu6UgMI0mBZsOmkiVMIkBQP8V1Jvg/view).
- We will use pandas framework to import the data and perform further analysis
on it.
- We will use pandas framework to import the data and perform further analysis
on it.
- Scaled Data and selected required features

#### **Training model using different techniques**

- Split data into test and train datasets. 
- We can used logistic regression classifier,SVM, Gradient Boost Classifier, Random Forest, MLP on training dataset. 
- Calculated accuracy and ROC_AUC on the test dataset and visualize it. 
- Tuned hyperparameter.
- Visualised using confusion matrix using sklearn. 

#### **Model Comparison**

- Compared models based on accuracy and ROC_AUC score.
